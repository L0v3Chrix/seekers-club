working their program‚Äîwhether you're in early recovery, decades into the journey,
or exploring a path out of darkness for the first time.

We believe all pathways that lead somebody out of darkness are worthy. While
rooted in AA traditions, we honor every authentic approach to recovery. What
matters is the willingness to grow, to serve, and to support each other.
```

**"What We Do Here" Section (Lines ~70-100)**
```typescript
// CURRENT:
This is a place for meditation, breathwork, wisdom sharing...

// NEW:
This isn't a treatment center. It's not therapy. It's a fellowship home‚Äîa place
where people in recovery:

‚Ä¢ Work their program together through meetings, step work, and spiritual practice
‚Ä¢ Sharpen each other through authentic connection and shared experience
‚Ä¢ Expand consciousness through meditation, breathwork, and contemplative practices
‚Ä¢ Practice service by showing up, supporting newcomers, and giving back

‚Ä¢ Working a 12-step program (AA, NA, CA, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Exploring recovery pathways for the first time
‚Ä¢ Seeking fellowship and spiritual growth
‚Ä¢ Looking for quiet space to work steps or reflect
‚Ä¢ Wanting to practice service and support others
‚Ä¢ Committed to consciousness expansion and healing

All pathways out of darkness are worthy. You belong here.
```

Andy's vision for a sanctuary space...

// NEW:
Andy's Recovery Journey

[Need Andy's actual recovery story - this is placeholder]

Andy founded The Seekers Club out of his own journey through recovery. Grounded
in the principles he learned in AA, he wanted to create a fellowship home where
people could work their program together, expand their consciousness, and support
each other's healing.

"Recovery saved my life. This space exists so others can find what I found‚Äî
community, consciousness expansion, and a pathway out of darkness."

The Seekers Club reflects Andy's belief that all pathways to recovery are worthy,
and that we grow stronger when we sharpen each other through fellowship and service.

### Task 6: Contact Page FAQ Updates

**File:** `app/contact/page.tsx`

**Current State:** General sanctuary FAQs
**Target State:** Recovery-specific questions and answers

#### FAQ Updates (Lines ~174-241):

**Replace ALL existing FAQs with recovery-focused versions:**

```typescript
<div className="space-y-6">
  {/* FAQ 1 */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      Is this a treatment center?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      No. The Seekers Club is a fellowship home and recovery community space.
      We&apos;re not licensed clinicians or treatment professionals‚Äîwe&apos;re
      people in recovery supporting each other.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 2 */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      Do I need to be in AA to come here?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      No. While we&apos;re grounded in AA principles, all pathways out of
      darkness are worthy. If you&apos;re working any recovery program (AA, NA, CA,
      SMART Recovery, etc.) or exploring recovery for the first time, you&apos;re
      welcome here.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 3 */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      Are there recovery meetings here?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      Yes! Recovery meetings are our primary offering. Text Andy for the current
      meeting schedule and to learn about upcoming gatherings.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 4 */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      Is this a sober space?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      Absolutely. No substances allowed on the property. This is a safe,
      substance-free environment for people in recovery.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 5 */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      I&apos;m new to recovery‚Äîcan I still come?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      YES. Newcomers are especially welcome. The Seekers Club is a judgment-free
      space where everyone is figuring it out together. Whether you&apos;re one day
      sober or exploring recovery for the first time, you belong here.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 6 */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      What if I relapsed?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      Come anyway. Recovery isn&apos;t linear, and this community understands that.
      All pathways include setbacks. You&apos;re still welcome, and we&apos;re still
      here for you.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 7 */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      Do I need to share my story?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      Never. You can participate as much or as little as feels right. Some people
      come just to sit in silence. Others come for deep fellowship. Both are perfect.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 8 - Keep existing */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      Is there a cost?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      The Seekers Club operates on a donation basis. Give what feels right, or
      nothing at all. This is about access and recovery, not profit.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 9 - Keep existing */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      What should I bring?
    </h3>

      Just yourself. We have meditation cushions, yoga mats, recovery literature,
      and whatever else you might need. If you have a favorite journal or blanket,
      feel free to bring those too.
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* FAQ 10 */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-display text-cosmic-gold-300 mb-2">
      Can I host a meeting or event here?
    </h3>
    <p className="text-cosmic-gray-300">
      Absolutely! If you&apos;d like to lead a recovery meeting, meditation,
      workshop, or gathering, text Andy to discuss. We love supporting
      community-led offerings and service work.
    </p>
